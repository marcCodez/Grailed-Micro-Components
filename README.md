In this project I wanted to revisit my knowledge of HTML and CSS. I wanted to ensure that I can completely understand these concepts entirely and feel completely comfortable with them, as I would shy away from ideas such as flexbox and grid. In this project I aimed to create a number of micro components of different web pages to solidify my knowledge with minimal help. However, I stumbled upon one of my favourite sneaker reseller websites named "Grailed" and realised I could build all the microcomponents of this "Add a listing" page as I immediately visualised how I woud implement each component which gave me sense of great excitement. Specific concepts that I focused on were flexbox, grid, media-queries, box model, specificity, rem units and positioning. I think the usage of rem units was one of the most significant changes for me instead of the use of pixels, as they are important to utilise essentially being relative to the elements on the page for a responsive layout.
